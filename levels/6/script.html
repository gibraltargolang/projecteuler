  <p>"Hey Gopher Lord! Good job.</p>
  <p>Lets play now with a bit harder problem</p>
  <p>Your job is to find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.</p>
  <p>hint: The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is -> 12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385</p>
  <p>The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is -> (1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025</p>
  <p>Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 − 385 = 2640</p>
