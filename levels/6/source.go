 * Mission: Sum square difference *
 ***********************
 *
 * Your job is to find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
 * hint: The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is -> 12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385
 * The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is -> (1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
 * Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640
